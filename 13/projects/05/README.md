# Project 13.05

Write a program named `sum.c` that adds up its command-line arguments, which are
assumed to be integers. Running the program by trying

```text
sum 8 24 62
```

should producte the following output:

```text
Total: 94
```

*Hint*: Use the `atoi` function to convert each command-line argument from string
form to integer form.

## Solution

See `sum.c`
