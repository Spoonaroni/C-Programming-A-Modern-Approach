## Exercise 8.08

Write a declaration for a two-dimensional array named `temperature-readings` that stores one month of hourly temperatur readings. (For simplicity, assume that a month has 30 days.) The rows of the array should represent days of the month; the columns should represent hours of the day.

## Solution

```c
int tempurature-readings[30][24];

```
