# Exercise 19.04

(a) Write an implementation of the `Stack` type, assuming that `Stack` is a
structure containing a fixed length array.

(b) Redo the `Stack` type, this time using a linked-list representation instead
of an array. (Show both `stack.h` and `stack.c`.)

## Solution

I genuinely do not understand what K.N. King wants me to do here. The answer
seems to just be the implementation from the book, only with some things removed.
I will be skipping it for now.

The answer is on his [website](http://knking.com/books/c2/answers/c19.html)
