## Exercise 03
 
For each of the following pairs of `scanf` format strings, indicate whether or not the two strings are equivalent. If they're not. show how they can be distinguished.

(a) `"%d"       versus " %d"`  
(b) `"%d-%d-%d" versus "%d -%d -%d"`  
(c) `"%f"       versus "%f "`  
(d) `"%f,%f"    versus "%f, %f"`  

## Solution

(a) `Equivalent`  
(b) `Equivalent`  
(c) `Not Equivalent: This will cause scanf to hang until a user enters a non-whitespace character`  
(d) `Equivalent`
