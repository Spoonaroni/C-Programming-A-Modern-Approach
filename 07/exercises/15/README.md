## Exercise 7.15

Use `typedef` to create types named `Int8`, `Int16`, and `Int32`. Define the types so that they represent 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit integers on your machine.

## Solution

`typedef char Int8` for 8 bit integers  
`typedef short Int16` for 16 bit integers  
`typedef int Int32` for 32 bit integers
