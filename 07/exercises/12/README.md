## Exercise 7.12

Suppose that `i` is a variable of type `int`, `f` is a variable of type `float`, and `d` is a variable of type `double`. Explain what onversions take place during the execution of the following statement:

```
d = i + f;
```

## Solution

`i` converts into a `float` and then the sum of `i` and `f` will be converted into the type `double`
