## Exercise 7.05

Which one of the following is not a legal way to write the number 65? (Assume that the character set is ASCII.)

```
(a) 'A'
(b) 0b1000001
(c) 0101
(d) 0x41
```

## Solution

(a) Legal. A is 65 in ASCII code
(b) Not Legal. I can't tell if this is supposed to be octal or binary. Either way it is wrong. Octal doesn't have letters and binary isn't allowed in C
(c) Legal. Normal octal
(d) Legal. Normal hexadecimal
