# Project 15.01

The `justify` program of Section 15.3 justifies lines by inserting extra spaces between
words. The way the `write_line` function currently words, the words closer to
the end of a line tend to have slightly wider gaps between them and the words at
the beginning. (For example, the words closer to the end might ahve three spaces
between them, while the words closer to the beginning might be seaparated by
only two spaces.) Improve the program by having `write_line` alternate between
putting the larger gaps at the end of the line and putting them at the beginning
of the line.

## Solution

See `line.c` and `new_output.txt`  

Unfortunately I do not believe this is the actual solution to this project.
However, I am currently incapable of getting the right answer. I may come back to
this project in the future, but for now this is good enough.
