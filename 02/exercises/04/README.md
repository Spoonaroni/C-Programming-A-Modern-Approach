## Exercise 2.04

Write a program that declares several `int` and `float` variables—without initializing them—and then prints their values. Is there any pattern to the values? (Usually there isn’t.)

## Solution

See `4.c`

No there is not a pattern to the values. This is because when declaring variables and then not initializing them, you end up with "garbage values" that usually amount to just random numbers.
