## Exercise 2.02

Consider the following program:  

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Parkinson's Law:\nWork expands so as to ");
    printf("fill the time\n");
    printf("available for its completion.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

(a) Identify the directives and statements in this program.  
(b) What output does the program produce?  

## Solution

(a) The directive is the `#include <stdio.h>` at the top of the program. The statements are the lines included in the `main` function.  
(b) The output of the program is:
```
Parkinson's Law:
Work expands so as to fill the time
available for its completion.

```
