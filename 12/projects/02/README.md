# Project 12.02

(a) Write a program that reads a message, then checks whether it's a palindrame (the
letter in the message are the same from left to right):

```text
Enter a message: He lived as a devil, eh?
Palindrome

Enter a message: Madam, I am Adam.
Not a palindrome
```

Ignore all characters the aren't letters. Use intger variables to keep track of position
in the array.

(b) Revise the program to use pointers instead of integers to keep track of positions
in the array.

## Solution

See `2.c`
