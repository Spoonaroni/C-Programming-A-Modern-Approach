## Exercise 6.05

Which one of the following statements is not equivalent to the other two (assuming that the loop bodies are the same)?

```c
(a) while (i < 10) {...}
(b) for (; i < 10;) {...}
(c) do {...} while (i < 10);
```

## Solution

(c) is not equivalent because the loop body will always be executed
