## Exercise 5.08

The following `if` statement is unnecessarily complicated. Simplify it as much as possible.  
(*Hint:* The entire statement can be replaced by a single assignment.)

```
if (age >= 13)
    if (age <= 19)
        teenager = true;
    else
        teenager = false;
else if (age < 13)
    teenager = false;
```

## Solution

```
teenager = age >= 13 && age <= 19 ? true : false
```
